# PyPiHyrdro

UNDER DEVELOPMENT:
PyPiHydro is an automated hydroponics system using a Raspberry Pi to control ph, nutrient level, watering and light schedules as well as other relevant envrinoment variables. Web App user interace allows easy access to all variables in the growing process as well as storing plant data to help increase yeilds on future growth through data analytics. Currently working on the UX of the app while testing the core features on the first round of plants. Will update with complete README file containing full instructions once the current base system is completed.
